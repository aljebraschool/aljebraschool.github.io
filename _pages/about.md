About
======
As a dedicated problem-solver, I have always been passionate about applying mathematical concepts to real-world issues. During my master's degree in Collective Intelligence, this passion was further enriched as I undertook research projects under esteemed supervisors.

Under the guidance of Dr. Benmarrakchi FatimaEzzahra, I developed a model to [monitor the eye movements of children with dyslexia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379118533_Eye_Movement_Tracking_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network) during digital activities using Convolutional Neural Networks. This project aimed to enhance understanding and support for individuals with dyslexia.

In addition, I explored the realm of [fake news detection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379082742_An_Analytical_Exploration_Assessing_the_Efficacy_of_Traditional_Machine_Learning_Techniques_and_LSTM_Models_in_Identifying_Fake_News?channel=doi&linkId=65fa68f1d3a0855142351d0f&showFulltext=true) under the mentorship of Dr. Manal El Akrouchi. Utilizing Natural Language Processing concepts, I implemented a model using traditional machine learning algorithms and compared its performance with a neural network called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

As I continue to leverage my mathematical background, my future goal is to deepen my understanding of how machine learning models truly learn from the data they receive. By combining mathematical principles with cutting-edge technologies, I strive to make a meaningful impact in the world.
