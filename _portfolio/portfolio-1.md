I spearheaded a semester-long academic project focused on enhancing Yoruba language learning through an innovative mobile app ["Akomolede"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aljebraschool.example.akomolede&pcampaignid=web_share) Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team, we combined expertise in Android app development, Yoruba language, and UI/UX design. Through thorough market research, we identified areas for improvement in existing Yoruba language learning apps on Google Play. Guiding the development process, we integrated insights from collective intelligence to create a user-friendly and impactful language learning tool. The successful launch of the ["Akomolede" app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aljebraschool.example.akomolede&pcampaignid=web_share) on Google Play has garnered over 500 downloads, showcasing its growing user base and contribution to promoting Yoruba language education.
